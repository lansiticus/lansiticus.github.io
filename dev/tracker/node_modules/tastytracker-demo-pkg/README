The files in the "Chapter 5 Files" folder are the three Bootstrap/HTML only files as they stand at the end of that chapter, plus the _custom.scss file which needs to be placed in the appropriate directory under the Bootstrap install and processed with Grunt, as described in the text of chapter 5.

The files in the "Chapter 7 Files" folder are the contents of JUST the application directory, not including index.html or any of the other files from the project directory, as they stand at the end of that chapter.

The files in "Final Files" are a complete set of application files in their final form.

DO NOT USE THE PACKAGE.JSON IN THIS DIRECTORY

The package.json file in the same directory as this README file is NOT the package.json file for the TastyTracker project! It's used only to install these examples. Don't use it.

IMPORTANT ADDENDUM TO CHAPTER 4 INSTALLATION DIRECTIONS

The instructions at the beginning of Chapter 4 got a little mangled in the editing process, and have caused confusion. We intended for the installation of the 'tastytracker-demo-pkg' package to be made into a *separate location* from your working project directory, and the files in that package used only for your reference as needed.

It was our intention that the three configuration files you need for initial setup in your ACTUAL project directory be entered by hand, using the listings given in Chapter 4. However, if you would prefer not to do the hand entry, the versions of those three files (package.json, tsconfig.json, and systemjs.config.js) in the "Final Files" directory are identical to the Chapter 4 listings.

In short, you should:

- Install the contents of tastytracker-demo-pkg into a separate directory, unrelated to your project directory

- Copy those three files, if using them, from the "Final Files" directory into your project directory

and from there on you should be able to run 'npm install' within your project directory and proceed as described in the text.

VERSION OBSOLESCENCE

The peril of writing a print book about a rapidly-changing technology is that it is immediately obsolete. In fact this book was obsolete before it went to press. When we last installed all the packages and dependencies from scratch, in July 2018, it still worked; but there is evidence that it may not keep working for much longer.

For example, the rxjs package has changed to semantic versioning and our requested version of "5.0.0-beta.12" is causing some complaints from other packages. You may have to change the requested version line in package.json to ">=5.0.1" and see how that works.

We try to keep track of any dependency changes which would be fatal to the project and make any necessary corrections here, but our time is limited. If you find a correction you think we need to make that can be done in these files (it's too late to change the book itself), please send it to us.
